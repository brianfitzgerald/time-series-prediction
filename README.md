# Stock Market Analysis

I was interested in learning to apply time series prediction to a number of domains. To do so, this repo implements a number of RNN-based, and one attention-based, architecture to predict mostly stock data. I've also implemented a number of eval metrics for each model.

Train:
```
python train.py
```

Tensorboard:

```
pip install tensorboard
tensorboard --logdir runs
```
